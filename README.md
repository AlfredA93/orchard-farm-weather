# Orchard Farm Weather Data Collection

Orchard Farm Weather Data Collection is an app for employees of Orchard Farm, Suffolk UK, to input weather data that they have collected for each day. This app then inputs this data into a spreadsheet and brings back a chart of the data, so the user can see the changes in the weather since 1993. The applications aim is to collect data for future use and display comparative historical data with the aim of atmospheric insight - to make the user aware of weather changes and how climate change is affecting the area in Suffolk.
